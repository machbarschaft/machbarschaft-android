Project Machbarschaft was created in the context of [WirVsVirus Hackathon](https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/) hosted by the German Government. Our pitch video can be found [on youtube](https://youtu.be/p7GuQokTwpM). We also have a [Devpost Profile](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=p7GuQokTwpM&event=video_description&q=https%3A%2F%2Fdevpost.com%2Fsoftware%2Feinanrufhilft&redir_token=9KWHas5EH2kGoMzfqHlKaS6FvmZ8MTU4NDk4NTMwOEAxNTg0ODk4OTA4) and a website [machbarschaft.jetzt](https://machbarschaft.jetzt/).

This repository contains the Android Application which is meant for the helper, to find nearby help seeking persons. New Users have to verify their Identiy with Passbase(ID - Verfication) and SMS. Afterwards they can help others in need.
