Project Machbarschaft was created in the context of [WirVsVirus Hackathon](https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/) hosted by the German Government. Our pitch video can be found [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YJ0I0dMmWg). We also have a [Devpost Profile](https://devpost.com/software/einanrufhilft) and a website [machbarschaft.jetzt](https://machbarschaft.jetzt/).

This repository contains the Android Application which is meant for the helper, to find nearby help seeking persons. New Users have to verify their Identiy with Passbase(ID - Verfication) and SMS. Afterwards they can help others in need. 

## How it works

1. Install the MACHBARSCHAFT app to your Android device.
2. Click "Register" and fill the form with your personal data. Then verify your identity via Passbase.
3. You will get a SMS with a code from us. Type in this code on the shown page.
4. You are almost done! Your account was created successful. Now you can login with your phone number.
5. Search a job in your location. Then you call the person seeking help and make your way.
6. That's it! Deliver the order. Please make sure to follow the behaviour rules which can be found [here](https://github.com/machbarschaft/machbarschaft/blob/master/Verhaltensempfehlungen_für_MACHBAR_EINKAUF.pdf).
